# BitPrint

**BitPrint** turns an [exported Bitwarden vault](https://help.bitwarden.com/article/export-your-data/) into a layout designed to be printed. Processing is handled client side.

I would not recommend using this for personal use. I made this for myself, more as of a proof of concept rather than something meant to be shared. Always be cautious when dealing with your exported vault.

**TL;DR: Do not import your personal vault on my site. Use the [demo](https://bitprint.kmr.io/?demo), your own fake data, or fork the repo and run it yourself.**
